                <p>My name is Christian Suleiman. I am currently and undergraduate student at the City College of New
                    York. I am
                    rising senior pursuing a Bachelor's of Science degree in the field of Computer Science. I am
                    currently
                    focusing on web development in hopes of entering the field upon graduation.</p>
                <p>Although my current focus is web development, I also have experience in object-orientated programming
                    and
                    algorithms. I have professional internship experience in broadcast engineering having interned at
                    NBC Sports
                    headquarters between 2017 and 2018. </p>

                <p>Born and raised in New York, I am seeking to advance my career in the Greater NYC area. My interests
                    include
                    graphic design, UX design, sports media, and traveling.
